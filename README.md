***This Repo is a boilerplate for running a Mongo Database locally***
  (Adam >> Keep this as a boilerplate so I don't have to keep rewriting these dbs... pls)

  - View Documentation folder for more specific instructions on how to spin up database, if you're running into issues.

  - This repo is meant to be cloned, and used as starter template to build out applications without having to worry about getting an API set up to serve a DB connection

  - For ease of use, three Models have been created (User, Team, Title), for the purposes of using them as model templates. And they are pretty universal, or can be changed very easily

**To Do**
 - Integrate a GraphQL layer to sit on top of the Mongo DB, which will be used to serve the client side of application
 - Documentation
